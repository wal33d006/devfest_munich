# DevFest Munich 2023 Flutter Workshop starter code

We will begin from this simple code where we have a simple API call bound to a UI, using cubit as state management. We
will build a nice architecture with the same API call in the same code.

## Preparations

- A working Flutter setup on personal laptops. Attendees will be asked to clone this repo and work along with the
  speaker
- Setup Flutter according to your operating system
  from [the official Flutter website](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- Try setting up [IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
  or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) if you wish to follow along with
  the speaker
- In the choice of your IDE above, install the Flutter plugin as well
- You would need Android Studio (with emulator) in order to build & run the code (check the link to the official website
  mentioned above)
- If you are on a Mac & you don't want to build for Android, you can build on iOS, for that you will need XCode (check
  the link to the official website mentioned above)
- The best ideal situation would be if you have this repo cloned & built the app on teh emulator before coming to the
  workshop. If you aren't able to build due to any issues, make sure you at least clone the repo, we will be doing most
  of the work in code.
- Some basic knowledge of Flutter would be great because there will be some parts where the speaker expects the audience
  to implicitly grasp things without deep explanations
- Attendees who will not have a personal laptop or are beginners in Flutter will also be able to attend this, it
  wouldn't be a definite MUST to follow the speaker throughout, grasping concepts & carrying it out later would also
  work.
