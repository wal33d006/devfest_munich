# DevFest Munich 2023 Flutter Workshop starter code

We will begin from this simple code where we have a simple API call bound to a UI, using cubit as state management. We
will build a nice architecture with the same API call in the same code.

## Preparations

- A working Flutter setup on personal laptops. Attendees will be asked to clone this repo and work along with the
  speaker
- Some basic knowledge of Flutter would be great because there will be some parts where the speaker expects the audience
  to implicitly grasp things without deep explanations
- Attendees who will not have a personal laptop or are beginners in Flutter will also be able to attend this, it
  wouldn't be a definite MUST to follow the speaker throughout, grasping concepts & carrying it out later would also
  work.
